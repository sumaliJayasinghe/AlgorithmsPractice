Prime number means that a number cannot be divided by some other number. It can be divided by itself.

Hint: smallest multiplication to form a number will be 2 * X. Numbers can be formed by multiplying two samller numbers than it half.

example : 15

half = 15/2 = 7.5 ~ 7

two numbers smaller than 7 can be used to form 15. like 3 * 5;


if number can be divided by some number smaller than its half, means its not a prime number.
